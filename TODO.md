# Restaurant Menu System - TODO List

## Current Issues

### 1. Duplicate Restaurant Creation
- **Problem**: System is creating duplicate restaurants with the same name
- **Required Fixes**:
  - [ ] Implement proper uniqueness check before restaurant creation
  - [ ] Consider using composite unique constraints (userId + slug)
  - [ ] Add validation to prevent duplicate restaurant names for the same user
  - [ ] Update the frontend to handle duplicate restaurant cases gracefully

### 2. Image Processing Integration
- **Problem**: Need to automate image creation and processing
- **Required Tasks**:
  - [ ] Implement automatic image generation for dishes
  - [ ] Add image optimization pipeline
    - [ ] Compress images
    - [ ] Generate different sizes (thumbnails, medium, large)
    - [ ] Convert to modern formats (WebP)
  - [ ] Set up CDN integration for image hosting
  - [ ] Add image upload validation and error handling
  - [ ] Implement image deletion when dishes/restaurants are deleted

## Next Steps

### 1. Restaurant Management
- [ ] Add proper error handling for duplicate restaurant names
- [ ] Implement restaurant deletion with cascade
- [ ] Add restaurant update functionality
- [ ] Implement restaurant status (active/inactive)

### 2. Image System
- [ ] Design and implement image processing pipeline
- [ ] Set up image storage system
- [ ] Create image optimization service
- [ ] Implement image caching strategy
- [ ] Add image upload progress indicators
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop image reordering

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement proper caching for restaurant data
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add pagination for large menus
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for images

### 4. User Experience
- [ ] Add loading states during restaurant creation
- [ ] Improve error messages and user feedback
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for important actions
- [ ] Implement undo/redo functionality for menu changes

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for restaurant creation
- [ ] Add integration tests for image processing
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for the main user flows
- [ ] Add performance testing for image optimization

## Notes
- Current implementation successfully creates restaurants and processes menus
- Need to focus on preventing duplicates and improving image handling
- Consider implementing a queue system for image processing
- Look into implementing a proper image CDN solution
